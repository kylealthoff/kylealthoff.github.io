      <header>American Medical College Application Service / AMCAS 4 Schools </header>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>AMCAS 4 Schools is a new initiative to give Medical Schools greater insight into their student data. This is part of an overhaul of the old platform and this application is one facet of that product strategy. Creating this new application would give the AMCAS team a new revenue stream that was previously not available.</p>
        <p>The old platform is out of date and had not been updated since the early 2000s. The platform was used to allow Medical School Deans & Administrators to view reports on their data and to see all student applications. This application will improve upon those reports and allow users to view their data in a dashboard. Users will be able to gleam greater insights through data visualization as well. This solution will not replace the current reports completely but will allow a new channel for those reports to be added [to this application] and updated when the time comes.</p>
        <p>AMCAS is a service within AAMC to allow potential medical students to apply to medical schools. They contain multiple products for the application process that aid Students and Medical School Administrators. Currently, all US MD medical schools with the exception of those from Texas and some in California, are part of the AAMC family and utilize the AMCAS services to manage their student applications. This allows for standardization of application forms and processes to lessen the burden for potential students and medical schools.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>In this role, I was the UX designer for the application. I worked closely with the Product Owners, Business Analyst, Project Manager, and Developers. We held weekly meetings to present designs promised from last week and to discuss any new issues or designs needed for the upcoming week. Besides the weekly meeting I was in consistent collaboration with the team. UX was brought in during the initial requirements phase and we started working on the designs along side requirements gathering in an agile life cycle.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>User Feedback</h2>
        <p>To gain a better understanding of what problems users encountered, user feedback was gathered by a mix of customer support emails and user interviews. We conducted 4 user interviews with 4 different medical schools. From user feedback, there was a consensus of medical schools who found the current reports useful but would like to have more reports than just the ones provided. There were also some medical schools that did not utilize reports as is and took the data to manipulate in excel or their data analysis tool of choice. To fill this need the team wanted to come up with a new product that would offer more flexibility and more reports than currently available. We started coming up with ideas for how this product should fit into the existing landscape of applications.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Feature Roadmap</h2>
        <p>The team started by conducting an exercise where everyone would write down on post-it notes their nice to have features and then posting it on the board. After putting up the post-it notes, we were all given 3 stickers to add to the features we thought were the most needed. Based on this list we were able to prioritize what was important for a new product. Eventually we decided for the product to be a dashboard / reporting tool which gave the user access to set reports and would allow the user to eventually create custom reports.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>New Global Navigation</h2>
        <p>For this new application, the first piece to tackle was how everything would be organized. The previous navigation was not holding up well over time. Based on use of the navigation in other products, there were issues that appeared when adding more links to the navigation because of limited space. The old global navigation was designed with only web in mind and not for products/applications.</p>

        <h2>Home Page / New Notifications</h2>
        <p>After discussion, it was not practical to land the user on the dashboard right away as some users may not have access to certain reports such as the dashboard. Landing the user on the home page first solved that issue.</p> 

        <p>The home page includes notifications that can be set by the AMCAS team to let users know about any upcoming updates or maintenance to the product among other events. Also, included in the home page is a way for users to see statistics or information based on their student data. This would allow the user to see relevant data on a regular basis in a timeline.</p>

        <p>Eventually, this feature would be configurable by the user to show them the information they would want at regular times (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly). </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Reports</h2>
        <p>The application is organized by reports with each link in the navigation being an individual report. The future state is to allow the user to configure their own reports but for MVP there will be a set number of reports offered.</p>

        <p>The first report users would most likely see and use would be the Dashboard. To identify the most important data points and their priority in the dashboard, we sent out a survey to medical schools to understand their data needs.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Drill Down Views</h2>
        <p>The most important data points are displayed in the tiles. The tiles can be clicked on to view more details about the data point.</p>

        <p>Initially the users are only concerned with their numbers and if they are improving or not. If a user notices a trend, they can then view more information by clicking into the tile to view that category of data to understand more. </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Filters</h2>
        <p>Filtering can give the user a way to view the reports and customize them on the fly. This would be a stepping stone to full customization but for MVP, filters are only ad hoc and not able to be saved. To better understand what filters would be needed we sent out a survey.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Showing Data Together (Data Views)</h2>
        <p>Another feature which allows greater insight for users is to allow them to compare their data against the entire pool of medical school applicants at the national level. This can give them greater insight into how they are doing compared to the average.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/school-data.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Showing only the Schools data</span>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/national-school-data.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Showing both the Schools data and National data</span>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Different Views of Same Data</h2>
        <p>Data visualization is best when viewing the data in different presentations, insights that were not seen before become apparent. A couple of the reports were designed to be viewable in different visualizations.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Map</h2>
        <p>Allowing users to view their data in a geographic visualization gave them greater insight into where their students were coming from. This map shows data down to the county level. When viewing the county data further data points show up in the tiles below the map.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/map.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There is still a lot of work to do on this product. Many of the designs and feature were left out to accommodate for MVP. Throughout the project we showed the designs in a clickable prototype to users and received good feedback on the direction. Starting from scratch and beginning in the initial stages of product development was a great learning experience though not without a steep learning curve. The product design had been approved and a working product had been developed for MVP as of September 2018.</p>
