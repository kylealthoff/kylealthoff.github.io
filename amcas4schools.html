      <section>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>AMCAS 4 Schools is a new initiative to give Medical Schools greater insight into their student data. This is part of an overhaul of the old platform and this application is one facet of that product strategy. Creating this new application would give the AMCAS team a new revenue stream that was previously not available.</p>
        <p>The old platform is out of date and had not been updated since the early 2000s. The platform was used to allow Medical School Deans & Administrators to view reports on their data and to see all student applications. This application will improve upon those reports and allow users to view their data in a dashboard. Users will be able to gleam greater insights through data visualization as well. This solution will not replace the current reports completely but will allow a new channel for those reports to be added [to this application] and updated when the time comes.</p>
        <p>AMCAS is a service within AAMC to allow potential medical students to apply to medical schools. They contain multiple products for the application process that aid Students and Medical School Administrators. Currently, all US MD medical schools with the exception of those from Texas and some in California, are part of the AAMC family and utilize the AMCAS services to manage their student applications. This allows for standardization of application forms and processes to lessen the burden for potential students and medical schools.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>In this role, I was the sole UX designer for the entire application. I worked closely with the Product Owners, Business Analyst, Project Manager, and Developers. We held weekly meetings to present designs promised from last week and to discuss any new issues or designs needed for the upcoming week. Besides the weekly meeting I was in consistent collaboration with the team. UX was brought in during the initial requirements phase and we started working on the designs along side requirements gathering in an agile life cycle.</p>

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>From user feedback, there was a consensus of medical schools who found the current reports useful but would like to have more reports than just the ones provided. There were also some medical schools that did not utilize reports as is and took the data to manipulate in excel or their data analysis tool of choice. To fill this need the team wanted to come up with a new product that would offer more flexibility and more reports than currently available. We started coming up with ideas for how this product should fit into the existing landscape of applications. The team started by conducting an exercise where everyone would write down on post-it notes their nice to have features and then posting it on the board. After putting up the post-it notes, we were all given 3 stickers to add to the features we thought were the most needed. Based on this list we were able to prioritize what was important for a new product. Eventually we decided for the product to be a dashboard / reporting tool which gave the user access to set reports and would allow the user to eventually create custom reports.</p>

        <h2>New Global Navigation</h2>
        <p>For this new application, the first piece to tackle was how everything would be organized. The previous navigation was not holding up well over time. Based on use of the navigation in other products, there were issues that appeared when adding more links to the navigation because of limited space. This was difficult to work around as there were other elements in the navigation such as account/login, and the page title. The old global navigation was designed with only web in mind and not for products/applications.</p>

        <img class ="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/old-nav.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Old Navigation</span>

        <p>The new solution is completely vertical and placed on the left side. This vertical navigation allowed for many links to be displayed easily without being cluttered or taking up space that could be dedicated to the main content. Users can find what they are looking for easily because all links can be shown at once and not hidden within sub-navigation as in the prior solution. </p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/new-nav.png">
        <span class="img-desc">New Navigation</span>

        <p>Along with the new vertical navigation there is a horizontal page navigation which includes the login and account info. The horizontal page navigation is made to be transparent so that it does not overshadow the main content which is the most important part.</p>

        <h2>Home Page / New Notifications</h2>
        <p>After discussion, it was not practical to land the user on the dashboard right away as some users may not have access to certain reports such as the dashboard. Landing the user on the home page first solved that issue. The home page includes notifications that can be set by the AMCAS team to let users know about any upcoming updates or maintenance to the product among other events. Also, included in the home page is a way for users to see statistics or information based on their student data. This was included within the notifications and showed the user an up to date statistic with the data visualized as well. This would allow the user to see relevant data on a regular basis and not clutter the home page with information that may or may not be useful if it were designed in a dashboard type interface. Eventually, this feature would be configurable by the user to show them the information they would want at regular times (i.e. daily, weekly, monthly). </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Reports</h2>
        <p>The application is organized by reports as the student data is what is most important. There are many different reports initially included. The future state is to allow the user to configure their own reports but for MVP there will be a set number of reports offered. Users are already used to reports so organizing the application in this manner allows for the users to be able to easily use the product.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/reports.png">


        <p>The first report users would most likely see and use would be the Dashboard. This is meant to be a high level overview of all aspects important to medical schools which in the future can be configurable. But for MVP we decided to keep this static. To identify the most important data points we sent out a survey to medical schools to understand their data needs.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tile Cards</h2>
        <p>The reports needed to be consistent and be customizable for all data points. Tiles were designed to be set sizes and have many variations. Tiles would also allow flexibility in the future for any new dashboard configurations. The tiles can be set on a 3 column grid but can be expanded to a 4 column grid. Anything larger or smaller than 3 or 4 columns would not be easily readable by the user. While this system is scalable to smaller sizes such as in mobile it would not be beneficial to the user to see the tiles in such a small screen especially since some of the tiles can be quite large and data visualization does not lend itself to small screens too well. </p>

        <img class="a4s-img-tiles" src="img/a4s/tiles.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Examples of Tile Sizes</span>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Drill Down Views</h2>
        <p>The most important data points are displayed in the tiles. The tiles can be clicked on to view more details about the data point. This then will take the user to the next level of drill down to show further details about the data point. The first level of the dashboard is only showing counts but the second level in the drill down shows data visualization and further breaks down the information.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img-drillDownViews" src="img/a4s/drill-down-views.png">

        <p>Initially the users are only concerned with their numbers and if they are improving or not. If a user notices a trend, they can then view more information by clicking into the tile to view that category of data to understand more. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Filters</h2>
        <p>Filtering can give the user a way to view the reports and customize them on the fly. This would be a stepping stone to full customization but for MVP filters are only ad hoc and not able to be saved. There are a lot of filters in this application. Including all the filters may not be the best use of time. There may not be a need for all filters. So to better understand what filters would be needed we sent out a survey. After sending out a survey to understand what users would want to filter on, we were able to come up with a list to start and identified the top 5 that would be implemented first.</p>

        <h2>Showing Data Together (Data Views)</h2>
        <p>Another feature which allows greater insight for users is to allow them to compare their data against the entire pool of medical school applicants at the national level. This can give them greater insight into how they are doing compared to the average.</p>
        <p>This is handled by the view dropdown at the top right corner of the screen which is a multi select. This allows the user to select what they want to show in the data set. This selection is then persisted throughout the entire application.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/school-data.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Showing only the Schools data</span>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/national-school-data.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Showing both the Schools data and National data</span>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Different Views of Same Data</h2>
        <p>The great thing about data visualization is in that viewing the data in different presentations, insights that were not seen before become apparent. For a couple of the reports, They were designed to be viewable in multiple different formats. This was only possible in the reports that did not have the option for data to be compared to the national level. Those reports able to have data represented multiple ways were only static reports and not meant to be used for comparison.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Map</h2>
        <p>Allowing users to view their data in a geographic visualization gave them greater insight into where their students were coming from. This map shows data down to the county level. When viewing the county data further data points show up in the tiles below the map.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/a4s/map.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There is still a lot of work to do on this product. Many of the designs and feature were left out to accommodate for MVP. Throughout the project we showed the designs in a clickable prototype to users and received good feedback on the direction. Starting from scratch and beginning in the initial stages of product development was a great learning experience though not without a steep learning curve. The product design had been approved and a working product had been developed for MVP as of September 2018.</p>
