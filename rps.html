      <section>
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>The current website had not been updated since the early 2000s. It was time to redesign the site to be more relatable for current students. The design and technical side were both out of date. The underlying service is solid and has many users who rely on these sites but RPS just needed a new user experience to enhance the usefulness of the service.</p>
        <p>The Careers in Medicine service is given to all US MD medical students and is accessible to anyone else for a yearly fee of $75. The current service allows users to access applications and content that aid the student in their residency search. RPS is one of many sites that give users decision making capabilities for their journey to residency.</p>
        <p>This is a vital resource to students and so it was important to make sure that the website is up to date and usable, so the service will continue to attract new users.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>In this role I was the UX Designer of the site, working with a UX Developer, and the UX Director. We conducted weekly meetings with the Development team to discuss any issues and upcoming work. Also, we conducted weekly meetings with the Product owners to present and gain feedback on our designs. UX Design was working at least 1 sprint ahead of development.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_agile.svg" class="rps-img-process">
        <p class="rps-section-process-p">The application was designed utilizing an Iterative Design approach. We focused on designing 1 feature at a time and iteratively designed that feature until we were satisfied and then moved onto the next feature. Most features took at least 2 Design Sprints to complete. The longest amount of time spent on a feature was 4 sprints. Our Design Sprints lasted 1 week.</p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_User Testing.svg" class="rps-img-userTesting">
        <p class="rps-section-userTesting-p">Each feature was tested with users at least once. For each user test there were at least 3 users and at most we had 8. We tried to reach out to different users each time depending on availability. We had some users who were utilized more than once. User testing was conducted utilizing the guerrilla testing method. We wanted quick and fast results to validate our assumptions.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_Stakeholder.svg" class="rps-img-stakeholder">
        <p class="rps-section-stakeholder-p">In the beginning of the project we conducted stakeholder interviews with each of the product owners. This gave us insight into the features wanted by each owner and allowed us to understand what was the most important to them. These interviews helped all of us to gain a common understanding of what we wanted to accomplish in the project. We knew, from our interviews, to prioritize highlighting the data as much as possible and to focus on making the site as accessible to all users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Features Roadmap</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_project-plan.svg" class="rps-img-features">
        <p class="rps-section-features-p">From the stakeholder interviews we were able to create a document with all the features that were important. Then we showed the document to everyone on the team and conducted a session where we all prioritized features from most necessary to least necessary. From this we came up with a features roadmap that we used when starting to design the site.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>Based on previous studies and feedback, there were a few things we already knew about students… 
            <ul>
              <li>Students rely heavily on our websites and information to make decisions</li>
              <li>MD and DO students equally use our resources</li>
              <li>Students need up to date and correct information to make the best decisions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Also, based on previous research we understood the different types of students that were coming to use our service…</p>
        <p><strong class="rps-subheading">Students Profiles</strong>
          <ul class="rps-section-list">
            <li class="rps-section-list-item">
              <img src="img/svg/med-student-none.svg" class="rps-section-list-img">
              <div class="rps-section-list-text">Students don’t know what they want when they are coming to our sites</div>
            </li>
            <li class="rps-section-list-item">
              <img src="img/svg/med-student-specialty.svg" class="rps-section-list-img">
              <div class="rps-section-list-text">Students know what specialty they want and come to our site to find residencies within that</div>
            </li>
            <li class="rps-section-list-item">
              <img src="img/svg/med-student-map.svg" class="rps-section-list-img">
              <div class="rps-section-list-text">Students know what area they want but not the specialty</div>
            </li>
            <li class="rps-section-list-item">
              <img src="img/svg/med-student-all.svg" class="rps-section-list-img">
              <div class="rps-section-list-text">Students know both specialty and area and want to refine their search further
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These 4 student profiles were used to help aid the design of the site to make sure we accounted for all of these use cases.</p>
        <p>There was an existing style guide that was utilized to save time when designing the site.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Success Metric</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_success-session.svg" class="rps-img-success">
        <p>Based on stakeholder input and user feedback were determined the best success metric was <strong class="rps-section-highlight">Session Time</strong>.</p>
        <p>Session Time is the time a user spends on our site. In the current version the average session time is <strong>4 minutes and 10 seconds</strong>. We wanted to improve this metric and optimize for users spending more time on our site. Increased session time would mean that users were more engaged with our content.</p>
      </section>  

      <section>
        <h2>Show Something on the First Page</h2>
        <p>The first page used to require the user to input all search criteria before showing any results. Based on the student profiles we know that some students don’t know what they are looking for when coming to our site. To accommodate those students we decided to go with an approach that showed the users the first 5 results and let the users filter from there.</p>
        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/show-something-results.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>MD vs DO Views</h2>
        <p>Based on previous research, we knew that the experiences of the DO students should be taken into consideration as well. Previously, the focus has always been on the MD students as their schools are part of the AAMC organization. But with the changing landscape DO students also heavily apply to MD residencies and their experiences should be accounted for as well.</p> 

        <p>To do so we created role based views for the user based on whether they were a DO student or an MD student. These role based views did not remove any information for the DO students. The MD students were not able to see any DO residencies in the results list. Though, DO students were able to see both MD and DO residencies.</p>
        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/md-do-views.png">
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h2>Filters & Sort</h2>

        <p>Allowing the users to see results first without any input from them, completely changes how the user interacts with the content. Now instead of knowing ahead of time what you are searching for a user can use the filter and sort features to narrow down their search.</p>

        <p>The filter tags were a completely different interaction than the previous site. Within the previous site a user would have to start a new search if they didn’t like the results they found. Now with the new Filter component the user can just remove or add filter tags and the results will update.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/filter-tags.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>All on One Page</h2>
        <p>Moving onto the Residency Program Detail view, our decision was to have all information for the Residency Program onto one page.</p>
        <p>There is a lot of information included within the Residency Program page and the previous site hid all the information within multiple tabs.</p>
        <p>After user testing, we found that clicking was viewed as more annoying than scrolling to view content. With these findings it validated the decision to keep the content all on one page.</p>
        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/all-on-one-page.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>The data included in the Residency Program pages is what sets this site apart from other sites. It aggregates many data sources into one place.</p>
        <p>There was a standard library (highcharts.js) already used for all data visualization in AAMC applications. All visualizations had to be designed with this library in mind.</p>
        <p>Using data visualization allows the user to gain greater insights into the data than by text alone. Basic visualizations such as pie charts, line charts, and bar charts were utilized.</p>

        <img class="rps-basicCharts-img" src="img/rps/basic-charts.png">

        <p>Along with more interesting visualizations such as this bubble chart that was utilized to show the differences in Race and Ethnicity.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/bubble-chart.png">

        <p>Other visualizations utilized were more infographic style. This one created is displaying the Prior Experience Residents gained before joining the residency program.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/prior-experience.png">

        <p>The most difficult visualization to design was the Graduate Career Plans. This visualization shows what roles and careers Residents move onto after completing residency. Graduate Career Plans was designed as an infographic style.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Quality & Privacy</h2>
        <p>Data Quality and more important Data Privacy are big concerns of this service. The data needs to be up to date and correct. Also, the privacy of the individuals data we are using needs to be accounted for as well.</p>
        <p>Because of data privacy concerns some data was not shown. Hiding the data was not good practice. Instead, any section with data that was missing or couldn’t be shown because of too little data points was still shown but only with a note explaining why the data was missing.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img-dataPrivacy" src="img/rps/data-privacy.png">
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Interactive Map View</h2>
        <p>We know from the student profiles that there are some students that are constrained to a certain area maybe because of a spouse or family. The interactive map was designed to aid these students but also allow any other students to be able to see all programs within a certain state on the map.</p>

        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/map-country.png">
        <span class="img-desc">Country View - User will click on a State to go to the State view</span>
        <img class="adjust-img" src="img/rps/map-state.png">
        <span class="img-desc">State View - User can see all institutions and select one to show institution card</span>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <img src="img/svg/noun_conclusion-rps.svg" class="rps-img-conclusion">
        <p>The iterative design approach and the amount of time we had allowed us to really take our time and produce thoughtful work. The team was also one of the best I've worked with. Everyone was interested in being a part of the design and was respectful and helpful in making the product better. The entire team wanted to see the product succeed.</p>
        <p>Currently, the Residency Program Search was launched for users at the beginning of 2018. We were able to increase Session Time to <strong>5 minutes and 29 seconds</strong> on average.</p>
